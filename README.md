## YOUR PROJECT NAME

Drive Nation is an online driver's license training school.

## About

Concretely Drive Nation is a web / mobile application which offers the possibility of obtaining a driving license in a simple, secure manner, without moving around and at your own pace.  It offers tailor-made online training for the preparation of the road traffic test and driving lessons given by qualified road instructors to prepare for the practical test of the driving license.
 We follow through our platform the evolution and the score of each candidate in order to make Africans responsible drivers.
 We also offer a connection of the customer with the best driving school nearby thanks to a geolocation.

## Why

The solution addresses the following issues:
 -Driving license is the most common exam in Africa but it is clear that it is sometimes issued in a suspicious, corruptible and illegal manner.
 -Every hour, 26 people die in Africa as a result of a traffic accident according to the World Health Organization (WHO).
 -We record annually in Côte d'Ivoire alone, around 10,000 traffic accidents causing more than 900 deaths and more than 12,000 injuries and according to the Road Safety Office (OSER), 95% of accidents are due to factors  humans.

 The objective is to digitize the driving school and all the procedures for obtaining a driving license to make Africans responsible drivers and thus reduce the number of traffic accidents linked to human factors.
 The solution targets driving license candidates of the required age, transporters wishing to retrain training and road instructors looking for an educational improvement course.
 This solution is important insofar as it is part of the vision of registering Africa as a technological hub where the impossible has no limit with information and digital.
